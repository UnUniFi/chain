# Principle

Since sdk's nft module has very large blank space, a lot of principle rules have to be made before implementing the actual nft mint module outside of it.   

#### Id string generation logic

- `Class.Id`
- `NFT.Id`

#### Name and Symbol and URI rule

- `Class.Name`
- `Class.Symbol`
- `NFT.Name`
- `Class.Uri`
- `NFT.Uri`
- `Class.Description`
