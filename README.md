UnUniFi Protocol is a decentralized finance(DeFi) platform that provides tools and features that allow users to create a collateralized deposit position, to synthesize a number of assets pegged to legal currency using NFTs and cryptocurrencies as collateral. As long as your NFTs are pledged as collateral, some rewards will come in on their own through the automatic DeFi of the issued stablecoins. The mission is “Give all NFTs the opportunity to DeFi”.
